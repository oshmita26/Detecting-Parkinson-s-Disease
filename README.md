# Detecting-Parkinson-s-Disease
In this Python machine learning project, we learned to detect the presence of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease in individuals using various factors. We used an XGBClassifier for this and made use of the sklearn library to prepare the dataset. 
XGBoost is a new Machine Learning algorithm designed with speed and performance in mind. XGBoost stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting andis based on decision trees. In this project, we will import theXGBClassifier from the xgboost library; this is an implementation of thescikit-learn API for XGBoost classification.
The model achieved an accuracy of 94.87 %, which is great considering the number of lines of code.
